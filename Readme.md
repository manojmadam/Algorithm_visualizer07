# Sorting-visualizer

Sorting visualization is a program that demonstrates the process of sorting a list of elements using various sorting algorithms. It provides a graphical representation of how the elements are rearranged at each step of the sorting process.

By visualizing the sorting process, users can gain a better understanding of how different sorting algorithms work and compare their efficiency and performance.
